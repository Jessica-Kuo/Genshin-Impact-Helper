# Genshin-Impact-Helper

An app designed to help with currency calculations for the game Genshin Impact

(I initially made this so I could figure out how many primogems I needed to get per day to pull Xiao)

(Btw I did pull Xiao and he's great)

## Version 1.0:
Input how many primogems or fates you have, how many primogems or fates you want, and how many days you want to reach that goal in.

The app will calculate how many primogems you'll need to get per day to meet this goal.

## Roadmap/Future features:
(I want this to do other things to help me play the game, if you want other features, let me know!)

### Talent book/weapon material alarms
Toggle alarms for when certain materials are available in domains. Alarm will send at server reset of the day those materials are up (4:00AM your timezone).

### Resin countdown timer
Input how much resin you currently have, and a timer will start to count until your resin is fully recharged.
